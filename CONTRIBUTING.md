Issues Reports
----
Issue reports are welcome, but before you report an issue, please have a look though the issues, open and closed, and check for hints in the [TROUBLESHOOTING](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) page. It would be great to give some details of the device and version of Linux or FreeBSD in use along with the version of Shairport Sync you are using (use `$ shairport-sync -V` to get this). Then, if possible, some diagnostic information from the log or logfile would be useful.

In general, a log verbosity of 2 is plenty (`-vv`, or the relevant entry in the configuration file), and it's usally helpful if statistics have been enabled (`--statistics` on the command line, or the relevant entry in the configuration file).

If you are pasting in code or a log file, format it as code by preceding it and follow it with a line containg just three backquotes: 

\`\`\`
```
code or log file entries
```
