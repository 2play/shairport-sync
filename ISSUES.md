Issue Reports
----
Issue reports are welcome, but before you report an issue, please check that your version of Shairport Sync is up to date. You'll find details of releases at [Shairport Sync Releases](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync/releases).
Then, please have a look though the existing [issues](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync/issues), both open and closed, and check for hints in the [TROUBLESHOOTING](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) page. It would be great to give some details of the device and version of Linux or FreeBSD in use along with version and build configuration of Shairport Sync you are using (use `$ shairport-sync -V` to get this). Then, if possible, some diagnostic information from the log or logfile would be useful.

In general, a log verbosity of 2 is adequate (`-vv`, or the relevant entry in the configuration file), and it's usually helpful if statistics have been enabled (`--statistics` on the command line, or the relevant entry in the configuration file).

If you are pasting in code or a log file, format it as code by preceding it and following it with a line containing exactly three backquotes and nothing else ([see here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for more on formatting):
