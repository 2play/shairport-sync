Troubleshooting
-----
The installation and setup of Shairport Sync is straightforward on recent Linux distributions. Issues can occasionally arise caused by problems elsewhere in the system, typically WiFi reception and/or the WiFi adapter settings, the network, the router, firewall settings.

In this brief document will be listed some problems and some solutions.

### WiFi adapter running in power-saving / low-power mode

**Problem**

Shairport Sync is installed and running, but sometimes it disappears from the network, and sometimes it suffers from long dropouts.

**Possible Cause**

This can be caused by lots of things, but one of them is that the WiFi adapter may be set to run in a low-power or power-saving mode. If it's not busy, then after a while it goes into a low-power mode. This is bad as the device needs to be always connected to the network to provide the AirPlay service. You need to turn off power-saving mode. How you do this varies with platform and with WiFi adapter â€“ internet search is your friend. Here, for instance, is the command for the C.H.I.P. from Next Thing Co, which has built in WiFi and Linux and has the `iw` command installed:

```
iw dev wlan0 set power_save off
```

### UFW firewall blocking connections on Raspbian (Raspberry Pi)

**Problem**

You have installed Shairport Sync successfully, the deamon is running, you can see it from your remote terminal but you are unable to play a song.

**Before you change anything to your configuration**

- Type the following command:

  `sudo ufw disable`

- Try to launch a song from your remote device on the Shairport-sync one, if this works, proceed to the next step and follow the ones described below, in the solution section.

- Enable UFW through the following command:

  `sudo ufw enable`

**Solution**

You have to allow connections to your Pi from remote devices. To do so, after re-enabling UFW (see last step of the previous section), enter the following commands in shell:

```
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.1/16 to any port 3689 proto tcp
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.1/16 to any port 5353
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.1/16 to any port 5000:5005 proto tcp
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.1/16 to any port 6000:6005 proto udp
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.1/16 to any port 35000:65535 proto udp
```

You may have to change the IP adresses range depending on your own local network settings.

You can check UFW config by typing `sudo ufw status` in shell. Please make sure that UFW is active, especially if you have deactivated it previously for testing purpose.

Run your song from your remote device. Enjoy !
